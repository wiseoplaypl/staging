## Klarna Official with PS 1.7.2-1.7.4 (PHP <7.2)
On module install:
```
Installation of module klarnapayment failed. Unfortunately, the module did not return additional details.
```
In order Klarna Official to work with PHP versions lower than 7.2, you need to make `klarnapayment.php`
file as simple as possible. It needs to pass Prestashop PHP parser validation (PHP 5.6).
